#RAG with reflection

Add your API keys to env, give it a query or essay topic, and put any relevant docs you have into ./sources.

Based on <a href:'https://github.com/pinecone-io/examples/blob/master/learn/generation/better-rag/advanced-rag-with-canopy.ipynb'>sample code provided by Pinecone</a>, but with a bunch of updates for usability & robustness.
